# 🚀 Nest.js Demo Project  

## 📌 Description  

This Nest Demo repository is just a simple API project to play around with some features of NestJS. It covers the basics like **user authentication** and **MongoDB integration**, all wrapped up in a modular structure.  

This I made some time ago to try out Nest.js framework built-ins like **pipes**, **decorators**, **events**, and **error handling**, as well as integration with patterns like **DTOs** and **repositories**. The main intention behind this was to create a space to experiment.
